# Tripadvisor-Website
A travel website is developed for the established firm Tripadvisor. I identified many areas for improvement in my version and made refinements accordingly. The system includes enhancements such as an upgraded booking system, a login portal for registered users, improved search results for flight options, a dedicated booking confirmation page, a contact us page, a about us page, a user registration window, reduced advertisements, information on baggage fees, a reviews page with a feedback submission form, and additional features.
